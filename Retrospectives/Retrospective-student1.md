## Experience

I learned so much from this project. Before I was able to read the code we learned in the last module but after completing this project I feel much more confident being able to program anything by heart. I ran into many issues in the beginning, but as I kept completing more and more of the project and understanding how to program better, I was able to understand what was going on. There wasn't any communication with my group during the break but when we got back we talked about who would start working on the main page for our website and making sure everyone was merging and pushing their code to get the project done on time. My favorite part about the project is coding the javascript because I have coded in Java for a very long time (since 7th grade) and am very experienced in that language, so being able to code in something similar is fun. There are still some major differences but I was able to quickly learn them and apply my knowledge to figure it out.
