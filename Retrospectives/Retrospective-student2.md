## Experience

Git merging abomination. I had this project done with everything and more numerous times and it just kept breaking with merge conflicts an my inability to fix them. I work work on my own branch and do prs with ADO for work and it is so much better with multiple levels of reviews. Git hub ui is not as good as ADO and this just lead to so many more issues than I would usually have. The projects works and Im happy with the final project. The process to get there is tedious and I am about to pull into main and cross my fingers all goes well. From there I will test and validate. Thank you for everything this was a good course.
