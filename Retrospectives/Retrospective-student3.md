## Experience

My experience with this project was very good. Most of the project came pretty easily to me and made sense. The communication with my team members also went really well. After I had set up the main page in the pug file I worked on the coments page file and set it up similarly to the comments page in project 4 with the addition of the edit button. During the implentation of this, the enableEdit method was the hardest of the functions to implement. The hardest part of creating this method was creating a text field that would then submit its value to the table. Once I had finished this method everything else was easy to create. I went back to the index.pug file and made the list take the comments in from the local comments array. Something that I learned from this project was how to make a persistent database that could be saved inbetween the session. The example from this project is taking the tasks and making it available to be used in the list even after closing the webpage and coming back a different time. Overall, this project was fun and enjoyable while also being pretty easy.
