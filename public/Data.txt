This Major is very good, lots of things to learn from it
Really helped me out when I started working, every time I wake up I have lots of energy
Even though I am getting 5 hours of sleep a day, I feel like I'm getting 10 because of how effectively I am sleeping
The  University is very inviting except for lots of the staff sleeping on the job (they may be doing to good of a job)
