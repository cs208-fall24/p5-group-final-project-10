The University is amazing, the professors are very kind and love to talk about their experience with getting good sleep every day!
I think the University was doing too good of a job, I saw lots of staff sleeping on the job, but if you were lucky enough to find one awake, they would have all the energy in the world!
The school provided lots of help to get me prepared and walked me through why its important to learn how to sleep and how it will benefit you and after going there and mastering sleeping, I have been up and ready every day ready to take on the world!
Many of the people and staff at the school are very inviting and makes the experience much better!
I loved the way that the program is set up and how easy it is to be able to understand the complex homework.
