        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p> 
        | Global Academy of Condiment Sciences. 
        | This academy is located in the middle of the Sahara desert. 
        | This is due to the dunes that allow for many a person to slide down using mayonnaise.

            <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
            | This career path has very few opportunities. To get a job you must be 
            | elite at the dynamics of mayonnaise sliding. Most people who find jobs 
            | work at food themed theme parks where mayonnaise and slides can go together.

            <h3>Stereotypes of the Major</h3>
            <p>
            | Overly Passionate About Condiments - People assume these students can’t have a meal without a mayo-related commentary,
            | whether it’s a critique of the spread consistency on a sandwich or an unsolicited suggestion to “elevate” dishes with a homemade aioli.
            | Chronically Uncertain - Because of the “sliding” nature of their major, they’re often seen as indecisive or flaky,
            | with peers joking that their academic focus changes as often as their sandwich preferences.
            | Quirky and Overly Creative - These students are stereotyped as eccentric innovators, constantly pitching wild ideas like
            | “mayonnaise as an alternative fuel source” or “mayo-based skincare products,” much to the eye-rolling amusement of others.
